    "The document you provided contains questions and tasks related to operating systems, particularly focusing on process management, system calls like `fork`, `exec`, and `wait`, as well as concepts like file descriptor tables and I/O redirection. Below, I'll provide solutions to some of the questions:\n",

    "### 1) Relationship Between Parent and Child Processes Created by `fork()`\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:**\n",
    "- When `fork()` is called, a new child process is created, which is an exact copy of the parent process except for:\n",
    "  - The process ID (PID) is unique.\n",
    "  - The return value of `fork()` is `0` in the child process and the child's PID in the parent process.\n",
    "  - Resource sharing:\n",
    "    - Shared: File descriptors, memory mappings, and environment variables.\n",
    "    - Not shared: Process control blocks, signal handlers, and PID.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Use cases of `fork()`:**\n",
    "1. Creating worker processes in a server to handle client requests concurrently.\n",
    "2. Creating a new process to run a different program using `exec()`.\n",

    "### 2) Output Explanation of the Given Code\n",
    "\n",
    "**Code:**\n",
    "```c\n",
    "#include <stdio.h>  \n",
    "#include <unistd.h>  \n",
    "#include <stdlib.h>  \n",
    "int main()  \n",
    "{  \n",
    "    int cpid;  \n",
    "    cpid = fork();  \n",
    "    if (cpid == 0)  \n",
    "    {  \n",
    "        printf(\"child here.\\n\");  \n",
    "        printf(\"CHILD pid = %d\\n\", getpid());  \n",
    "        printf(\"CHILD ppid = %d\\n\", getppid());  \n",
    "    }  \n",
    "    else  \n",
    "    {  \n",
    "        printf(\"parent here.\\n\");   \n",
    "        printf(\"PARENT pid = %d\\n\", getpid());  \n",
    "        printf(\"PARENT ppid = %d\\n\", getppid());  \n",
    "        sleep(2);  \n",
    "    }  \n",
    "    return 0;  \n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:**\n",
    "- When `fork()` is called, both the parent and child processes execute the code following it.\n",
    "- Output:\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "  parent here.\n",
    "  PARENT pid = <Parent PID>\n",
    "  PARENT ppid = <Parent's Parent PID>\n",
    "  child here.\n",
    "  CHILD pid = <Child PID>\n",
    "  CHILD ppid = <Parent PID>\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "  - The child process executes the `if (cpid == 0)` block.\n",
    "  - The parent process executes the `else` block.\n",
    "  - The `sleep(2)` in the parent ensures the parent stays alive for at least 2 seconds after the child starts.\n",

    "### 3) Output Explanation of the Second Code\n",
    "\n",
    "**Code:**\n",
    "```c\n",
    "#include <stdio.h>   \n",
    "#include<unistd.h>   \n",
    "#include<fcntl.h>  \n",

    "int main(void){  \n",
    "    write(1, \"I am learning OS\", 17);  \n",
    "    write(1, \"I know what is syscall\", 23);  \n",
    "    write(1, \"I am going to run the echo command\", 35);   \n",
    "    execl(\"/usr/bin/echo\", \"echo\", \"i am here\", NULL);  \n",
    "    write(1, \"Should I be printed on screen or not\", 37);  \n",
    "    return 0;  \n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:**\n",
    "- Before `execl` is called, the program writes three strings to standard output.\n",
    "- The `execl` replaces the current process image with the new program `/usr/bin/echo`.\n",
    "- Any code after the `execl` call is not executed.\n",
    "- Output:\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "  I am learning OSI know what is syscallI am going to run the echo command\n",
    "  i am here\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "  The last `write()` statement is never executed.\n",
