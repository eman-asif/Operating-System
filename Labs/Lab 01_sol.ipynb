    "### **Task 01**:\n",
    "#### Part A: \n",
    "- **What is a hypervisor?**\n",
    "  A hypervisor, also called a virtual machine monitor (VMM), is software, firmware, or hardware that creates and runs virtual machines (VMs). A system on which a hypervisor runs one or more VMs is called a host machine, and each VM is called a guest machine.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Difference between Type 1 and Type 2 hypervisors**:\n",
    "  - **Type 1 Hypervisor**: Runs directly on the host's hardware. It is also known as a \"bare-metal hypervisor.\" Examples include VMware ESXi, Microsoft Hyper-V, and Xen.\n",
    "  - **Type 2 Hypervisor**: Runs on a host operating system as an application. It is also called a \"hosted hypervisor.\" Examples include VMware Workstation, VirtualBox, and Parallels Desktop.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Task 02**:\n",
    "#### Part A: Can there be a guest OS inside another guest OS?\n",
    "Yes, this is called **nested virtualization**, where a virtual machine (guest OS) runs a hypervisor to host another virtual machine.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Part B: What is the limit for nested guest OS(s)?\n",
    "The limit depends on:\n",
    "1. **Hardware Capabilities**: CPU, RAM, and storage.\n",
    "2. **Software/Hypervisor Limitations**: VMware, for example, supports nested virtualization but the number of layers depends on system resources and hypervisor configurations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Practically, the number of nested guests is limited by performance constraints rather than theoretical limits.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Task 03**:\n",
    "#### Part A: Format of the prompt:\n",
    "The prompt typically follows the format:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "<username>@<hostname>:<current-directory>$ \n",
    "```\n",
    "For example:\n",
    "`arif@Ubuntu:~$`\n",
    "- **username**: The user currently logged in (e.g., `arif`).\n",
    "- **hostname**: The name of the machine (e.g., `Ubuntu`).\n",
    "- **current-directory**: The present working directory (`~` represents the home directory).\n",
    "- **symbol ($/#)**: Indicates the user's privilege:\n",
    "  - `$`: Normal user.\n",
    "  - `#`: Root user (admin privileges).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Part B: Difference between `$` and `#`:\n",
    "- `$`: Used for a regular (non-root) user.\n",
    "- `#`: Indicates the shell has root (administrative) privileges.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Task 04**:\n",
    "Commands in `/usr/sbin` require administrative privileges to execute. If you attempt to run these commands as a normal user, youâ€™ll likely see a \"Permission denied\" error. Using `sudo` will allow you to execute them as an administrator.\n",
    "\n",
    "Try running:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "ls /usr/sbin\n",
    "```\n",

    "#### Part A: What does `shutdown 3` do?\n",
    "The command:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "shutdown 3\n",
    "```\n",
    "- Schedules a shutdown in **3 minutes**. The system will notify users about the impending shutdown.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Part B: What is a home directory?\n",
    "The **home directory** is the default directory assigned to a user on login. It is denoted by `~`. For example, `/home/arif`.\n",

    "2. **System calls** (e.g., `open`, `read`).\n",
    "3. **Library functions** (e.g., `printf`).\n",
    "4. **Special files** (e.g., `/dev/null`).\n",
