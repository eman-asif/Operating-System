    "The document contains questions and tasks related to interprocess communication (IPC), signals, threads, and multithreading concepts in operating systems. Below are detailed solutions for **Lab 04**:\n",

    "\n",
    "### **Task 1: IPC**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Purpose of IPC in Unix systems:**\n",
    "   - IPC allows processes to communicate and share data. It is essential for synchronization, coordination, and efficient resource utilization.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Difference between pipes and FIFOs (named pipes):**\n",
    "   - **Pipes:**\n",
    "     - Used for communication between related processes (e.g., parent and child).\n",
    "     - Temporary and exist only during the process lifecycle.\n",
    "   - **FIFOs:**\n",
    "     - Persistent and can exist in the filesystem.\n",
    "     - Used for communication between unrelated processes.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Diagram to explain pipes:**\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   Process 1 (write) → [Pipe] → Process 2 (read)\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   - Data written by Process 1 is read by Process 2 using a pipe.\n",
