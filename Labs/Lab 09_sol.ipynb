    "#### **2. Logical Block Addressing (LBA)**  \n",
    "Logical Block Addressing (LBA) is a method of addressing blocks of data on a storage device. Instead of using the traditional Cylinder-Head-Sector (CHS) addressing, LBA assigns a unique address to each block, making disk access faster and simpler.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Maximum Disk Size Supported:**  \n",
    "- **24-bit LBA:** \\( 2^{24} \\times 512 \\, \\text{bytes} = 8 \\, \\text{GB} \\)  \n",

    "#### **3. Hard Disk Interface**\n",
    "A hard disk interface is a connection protocol between the hard disk drive (HDD) and the computer's motherboard. It defines how data is transmitted, received, and controlled.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Features of Important HDD Interfaces:**  \n",
    "- **IDE/PATA:** Parallel data transfer, slower, older standard.\n",
    "- **SATA:** Serial data transfer, faster speeds (up to 6 Gbps), hot-swappable.\n",
    "- **SCSI:** Multi-device support, suitable for servers.\n",
    "- **NVMe:** High-speed access through PCIe interface, used in modern SSDs.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **4. Reading and Writing in CHS Disk**\n",
    "- **Reading:** The operating system locates the desired cylinder, positions the head over the correct track, and waits for the sector to align.  \n",
    "- **Writing:** The head writes data to the specified sector once the disk reaches the desired position.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Seek Time vs. Rotational Delay:**  \n",
    "- **Seek Time:** Time taken by the read/write head to move to the correct track.  \n",
    "- **Rotational Delay:** Time taken for the desired sector to rotate under the read/write head.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Mapping CHS to LBA:**  \n",
    "LBA reduces seek time by eliminating the need to calculate cylinder, head, and sector addresses for each read/write operation, instead using a single block address.\n",
