    "### **Task 1: User IDs and Special Permissions in Linux**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **1. Three Types of User IDs in Linux**\n",
    "1. **Real User ID (RUID)**:\n",
    "   - Identifies the user who owns the process.\n",
    "   - Used to check access permissions for files and directories.\n",
    "   \n",
    "2. **Effective User ID (EUID)**:\n",
    "   - Determines the privileges of the process.\n",
    "   - Can temporarily be different from the RUID when a program runs with SUID.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Saved User ID (SUID)**:\n",
    "   - Stores the EUID for processes that temporarily switch privileges and want to revert later.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **2. Purposes of SUID, SGID, and Sticky Bit**\n",
    "1. **SUID (Set User ID)**:\n",
    "   - Allows a program to run with the file owner’s privileges, regardless of the user executing it.\n",
    "   - Example: `/usr/bin/passwd` uses SUID so users can modify `/etc/shadow`.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **SGID (Set Group ID)**:\n",
    "   - When set on files, the file runs with the group owner’s privileges.\n",
    "   - When set on directories, files created inside inherit the directory's group ownership.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Sticky Bit**:\n",
    "   - Ensures only the file owner (or root) can delete or modify files in a directory.\n",
    "   - Example: `/tmp` directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **3. Difference Between \"s\" and \"S\" in Permissions**\n",
    "- **\"s\"**: Indicates SUID/SGID is active and executable permission is also set.\n",
    "- **\"S\"**: Indicates SUID/SGID is active but executable permission is **not** set.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "-rwsr-xr-x  1 root root 40960 /usr/bin/passwd  # \"s\": SUID is active, executable set\n",
    "-r-Sr--r--  1 root root 40960 /somefile        # \"S\": SUID is active, executable not set\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **4. Sticky Bit on a Directory**\n",
    "- **Effect**: Users can create files, but only the file owner (or root) can delete or modify them.\n",
    "- **Use Case**: Commonly set on `/tmp` to ensure multi-user security.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **5. SUID as a Security Risk**\n",
    "- If a program with SUID has vulnerabilities, attackers can exploit it to gain root privileges.\n",
    "- Example: Buffer overflow in a SUID program.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **6. Potential Issues Without Sticky Bit on `/tmp`**\n",
    "- Users could delete or modify other users' files, causing disruptions in a shared environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **7. Setting Up a Directory for Group `sports`**\n",
    "1. **Steps**:\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   mkdir ~/sports_dir\n",
    "   chgrp sports ~/sports_dir\n",
    "   chmod 2770 ~/sports_dir  # SGID for group ownership and write permissions\n",
    "   chmod +t ~/sports_dir    # Sticky bit for user-deletion protection\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Verify Permissions**:\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   ls -ld ~/sports_dir\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **8. Modifying SUID for `/usr/bin/passwd`**\n",
    "1. **Verify Permissions**:\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   ls -l /usr/bin/passwd\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Remove SUID and Test**:\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   chmod u-s /usr/bin/passwd\n",
    "   passwd  # Try changing the password; it will fail.\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Reset SUID**:\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   chmod u+s /usr/bin/passwd\n",
    "   passwd  # Test again; it will succeed.\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **9. Find Files with SUID, SGID, or Sticky Bit**\n",
    "- **Command**:\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   find / -perm /6000 -type f 2>/dev/null\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Task 2: Password Security and Access Control**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **1. Protection of `/etc/shadow`**\n",
    "- **Reason**: Contains hashed passwords; only root or programs with appropriate permissions (e.g., `passwd` with SUID) can access it.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **2. Advantages of SUID Over Daemons**\n",
    "- **SUID**:\n",
    "   - Temporary privilege escalation.\n",
    "   - Easier to manage and audit.\n",
    "   - Uses less system resources compared to daemons.\n",
    "- **Daemons**:\n",
    "   - Always running, consuming memory and CPU.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **3. ACLs vs. Traditional File Permissions**\n",
    "1. **Traditional Permissions**:\n",
    "   - Limited to owner, group, and others.\n",
    "2. **ACLs (Access Control Lists)**:\n",
    "   - Allow fine-grained control over access for specific users or groups.\n",
    "   - Example: Setting permissions for multiple users on the same file.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **4. Linux Password Security**\n",
    "- **Hashing**: Prevents storing passwords in plain text.\n",
    "- **Salt**:\n",
    "   - Adds randomness to the hash to prevent precomputed attacks like rainbow tables.\n",
    "   - Ensures unique hashes for identical passwords.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **5. Encoding, Hashing, and Encryption**\n",
    "- **Encoding**:\n",
    "   - Converts data into a different format for transmission or storage.\n",
    "   - Example: Base64 encoding.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Hashing**:\n",
    "   - One-way transformation of data.\n",
    "   - Example: Storing passwords using SHA-256.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Encryption**:\n",
    "   - Secures data with a reversible transformation using a key.\n",
    "   - Example: AES (symmetric encryption) or RSA (asymmetric encryption).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **6. Symmetric vs. Asymmetric Encryption**\n",
    "1. **Symmetric Encryption**:\n",
    "   - Same key for encryption and decryption.\n",
    "   - Example: AES.\n",
    "   - **Limitation**: Key distribution is challenging.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Asymmetric Encryption**:\n",
    "   - Uses a public key for encryption and a private key for decryption.\n",
    "   - Example: RSA.\n",
    "   - **Advantage**: Eliminates the need to share private keys.\n",
