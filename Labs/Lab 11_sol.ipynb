    "#### **What are Hard Links and Soft Links?**\n",
    "1. **Hard Link**: A direct reference (alias) to the same inode of a file. Both the original file and its hard link share the same data and inode.\n",
    "2. **Soft Link (Symbolic Link)**: A pointer to the original file’s pathname. It does not share the same inode as the original file.\n",

    "#### **Commands to Demonstrate Hard and Soft Links**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Create a file and links**:\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   echo \"Hello World\" > fileA\n",
    "   ln fileA hardlinkA  # Create a hard link\n",
    "   ln -s fileA softlinkA  # Create a soft link\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **View Inode Numbers**:\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   ls -li\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   Example Output:\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   1001 -rw-r--r--  1 user group 12 fileA\n",
    "   1001 -rw-r--r--  1 user group 12 hardlinkA\n",
    "   2001 lrwxrwxrwx  1 user group  7 softlinkA -> fileA\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **What Happens If the Original File is Deleted?**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **For Hard Links**:\n",
    "   - If `fileA` is deleted, the data remains accessible via `hardlinkA`.\n",
    "   - Justification: Hard links point directly to the inode, and deletion only reduces the link count of the inode.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **For Soft Links**:\n",
    "   - If `fileA` is deleted, `softlinkA` becomes a \"broken link.\"\n",
    "   - Justification: Soft links point to the file’s pathname, which no longer exists.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Why Do Hard Links Share the Same Inode?**\n",
    "Hard links reference the same inode, ensuring they point to the same data block. Soft links, however, are separate files with their own inodes and merely store the original file's path.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Command to Find Regular Files Without One Hard Link**\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "find ~ -type f ! -links 1\n",
    "```\n",
    "This finds all regular files in your home directory with more or fewer than one hard link.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Task 2: Permissions**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **1. Ownership After Copying a File**\n",
    "- **Commands**:\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   mkdir ~/permissions\n",
    "   cp /etc/passwd ~/permissions/\n",
    "   ls -l ~/permissions\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "- **Result**: The copied file is owned by the user performing the copy.\n",
    "- **Why?**: The copy operation creates a new file, which is owned by the user performing the operation.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **2. File Created by Root**\n",
    "- **Commands**:\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   su\n",
    "   touch ~/permissions/rootfile\n",
    "   exit\n",
    "   ls -l ~/permissions/rootfile\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "- **Result**: The file is owned by `root`.\n",
    "- **Why?**: The file is created by the root user, so ownership defaults to root.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **3. Changing Ownership and Permissions**\n",
    "- **Commands**:\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   chown -R $USER:$USER ~/permissions\n",
    "   chmod -R 744 ~/permissions\n",
    "   ls -l ~/permissions\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "- **Result**: Ownership changes to the current user, and permissions allow the owner full access, while others can only read.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **4. `chmod 734` vs. `rwxr-xr--`**\n",
    "- **734**:\n",
    "   - Owner: Read, write, execute.\n",
    "   - Group: Read, execute.\n",
    "   - Others: Read.\n",
    "- **rwxr-xr--**: Equivalent to 734.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **5. Testing Permissions**\n",
    "- **Commands**:\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   chmod 744 myfile\n",
    "   su otheruser\n",
    "   cat myfile  # Should succeed.\n",
    "   vim myfile  # Should fail for write.\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "- **Root Access**: Root can always read/write, regardless of permissions.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **6. Minimum Directory Permissions for Copy**\n",
    "To copy `/d1/d2/d3/f1.txt` to `/d4/d5/d6/`:\n",
    "- Source directories (`/d1`, `/d2`, `/d3`) need **execute** permission to traverse.\n",
    "- Source file (`f1.txt`) needs **read** permission.\n",
    "- Destination directories (`/d4`, `/d5`, `/d6`) need **write** and **execute** permissions.\n",
