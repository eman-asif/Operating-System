    "### **Task 01: Text Editors and Vim Modes**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **What is a text editor?**\n",
    "   - A text editor is a program that allows users to create, edit, and manipulate plain text files.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Examples of Linux text editors:**\n",
    "   - `vim`, `nano`, `gedit`, `emacs`, `kate`.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Modes of vim:**\n",
    "   - **Normal Mode:** Default mode for navigation and commands.\n",
    "   - **Insert Mode:** For editing and inserting text.\n",
    "   - **Command Mode:** For saving, quitting, or running shell commands (accessed using `:`).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Task 02: Practice with Vim**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Commands for cursor movement:**\n",
    "   - Beginning of the line: `0`\n",
    "   - End of the line: `$`\n",
    "   - Beginning of the file: `gg`\n",
    "   - End of the file: `G`\n",
    "   - Go to line 20: `20G`\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Editing Commands:**\n",
    "   - Delete the first line: `dd`\n",
    "   - Delete line 7: `7dd`\n",
    "   - Add \"AND DYNAMICS\" after line 15: `:15s/$/ AND DYNAMICS/`\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Search and Replace:**\n",
    "   - Find next occurrence of \"usr\" and replace: `/usr` + `:s/usr/USER`\n",
    "   - Replace all occurrences of \"usr\": `:%s/usr/USER/g`\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Open `practice.txt` at:**\n",
    "   - Last line: `vim + practice.txt`\n",
    "   - Line 21: `vim +21 practice.txt`\n",
    "   - Line with \"USER\": `vim +/USER practice.txt`\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Open two files:**\n",
    "   - Split horizontally: `vim -o practice.txt practice2.txt`\n",
    "   - Split vertically: `vim -O practice.txt practice2.txt`\n",
    "   - Switch files: `Ctrl + w + w`\n",
    "   - Copy and paste: Use `yy` to copy and `p` to paste.\n",

    "### **Task 03: Writing a `hello.c` Program in Vim**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Write a \"Hello, World!\" program:\n",
    "   ```c\n",
    "   #include <stdio.h>\n",
    "   int main() {\n",
    "       printf(\"Hello, World!\\n\");\n",
    "       return 0;\n",
    "   }\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Compile using vim command mode:\n",
    "   - Compile with `:!gcc -o hello hello.c`\n",
    "   - Run with `:!./hello`\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Return to vim after execution:\n",
    "   - Start a shell with `:sh`\n",
    "   - Run `./hello`, then exit the shell using `exit`.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Task 04: Compilation Steps**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Create a program:\n",
    "   ```c\n",
    "   #include <stdio.h>\n",
    "   int main() {\n",
    "       printf(\"Learning Linux is Fun with Arif Butt.\\n\");\n",
    "       return 0;\n",
    "   }\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Compilation steps:\n",
    "   - Preprocess: `gcc -E program.c -o program.i` (output: `.i` file)\n",
    "   - Compile: `gcc -S program.i -o program.s` (output: `.s` file)\n",
    "   - Assemble: `gcc -c program.s -o program.o` (output: `.o` file)\n",
    "   - Link: `gcc program.o -o program` (output: executable file)\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Task 05: Static and Dynamic Linking**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Static linking: `gcc --static -o static_cat program.c`\n",
    "2. Dynamic linking: `gcc -o dynamic_cat program.c`\n",
    "\n",
    "**Comparison:**\n",
    "- Static binaries are larger as they include all libraries.\n",
    "- Dynamic binaries are smaller and use shared libraries at runtime.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Use `strace` to inspect system calls:\n",
    "   - Example: `strace ./dynamic_cat`\n",
    "   - Look for `openat` calls to identify shared libraries (e.g., `libc`).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Task 06: Inspecting ELF Binaries**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Display disassembly:\n",
    "   - Command: `objdump -d -M intel program`\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Section headers:\n",
    "   - Command: `readelf -S program`\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Program headers:\n",
    "   - Command: `readelf -l program`\n",
    "\n",
    "4. ELF header:\n",
    "   - Command: `readelf -h program`\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Task 07: Background and Foreground Processes**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Run a program in the background:\n",
    "   - Command: `./program &`\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Switch between foreground and background:\n",
    "   - Background to foreground: `fg`\n",
    "   - Foreground to background: `Ctrl + Z` then `bg`\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Useful commands:\n",
    "   - `ps`: List processes.\n",
    "   - `top`: Monitor system activity.\n",
    "   - `vmstat`: Display system performance.\n",
    "   - `free`: Check memory usage.\n",
    "   - `uptime`: Display system uptime.\n",
    "   - `watch`: Periodically execute a command.\n",
