    "\n",
    "This is a comprehensive set of tasks covering both theoretical and practical aspects of operating systems. Here's how you can approach each:\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Task 1: Viva Preparation**\n",
    "Prepare answers for the given questions. For example:\n",
    "a. **Process Scheduling**: It’s a mechanism to select which process will run on the CPU next. Types include Long-Term, Short-Term, and Medium-Term Schedulers.  \n",
    "b. **Difference**: Long-term determines which processes are admitted; short-term decides which process runs next.  \n",
    "Let me know if you want detailed answers for any question.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Task 2: `sleep` and `renice`**\n",
    "1. Run the command: `sleep 300 &` (sends the process to the background).\n",
    "2. Find the PID of the sleep process using `ps`.\n",
    "3. Change the nice value with `renice`, e.g., `sudo renice -n 10 -p <PID>`.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Task 3: Nice Value with `find`**\n",
    "Use the `nice` command to adjust priority:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "sudo nice -n -20 find / -name \"*libc*\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Task 4: `schedtool`**\n",
    "Read the man page using:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "man schedtool\n",
    "```\n",
    "**Schedtool** is a utility to manipulate and query scheduling policies and parameters for processes.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Task 5: Process Scheduling Parameters**\n",
    "Include parameters like **priority**, **nice value**, **scheduling policy**, and **CPU affinity**. Let me know if you'd like detailed explanations.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Task 6: CPU Affinity**\n",
    "CPU affinity binds a process to specific CPU cores. Two types are **hard affinity** (strict binding) and **soft affinity** (preferred but not mandatory). Use `taskset` or `/proc/[PID]/status` to explore this.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Task 7: Schedtool Parameters**\n",
    "Use:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "schedtool -n -p <PID>\n",
    "schedtool -l\n",
    "```\n",
    "to list scheduling policies.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Task 8: Change Scheduling Parameters**\n",
    "Commands for experiments:\n",
    "- Policy: `schedtool -B -p <PID>` (Batch), `-I` (Idle), `-N` (Normal).\n",
    "- Nice Value: `renice`.\n",
    "- Static Priority: `schedtool`.\n",
    "- CPU Affinity: `taskset`.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Task 9: `/proc` Filesystem**\n",
    "Answering some key questions:\n",
    "- **Why a window to the kernel?**: It provides dynamic runtime information about processes and system status.\n",
    "- **File sizes**: They appear as 0 because they’re dynamically generated.\n",
    "- **File descriptions**:\n",
    "  - `cmdline`: Command-line arguments of the process.\n",
    "  - `environ`: Environment variables.\n",
    "  - `limits`: Resource limits.\n",
    "  - `status`: Process metadata.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the rest, explore files like `/proc/cpuinfo` for CPU info, `/proc/uptime`, and `/proc/sys/kernel`.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "Would you like detailed explanations or practical commands for any specific task?"
